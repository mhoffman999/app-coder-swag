//This is a SINGLETON
//A Singleton is a design pattern
//A Singleton will remain in the apps memory forever (unlike Classes or Structs which are created and destroyed as needed)
//Therefore, BE CAREFUL of the amount of Singletons created and how much data each one holds
class DataService {
    
    //"static" means there is only ever one copy in memory
    //Therefore, anytime the app references "instance", it will be the same (only) example of that data
    //The constant "instance" is created with a brand new copy of DataService, but it is static
    //This constant will hold the data for the app
    static let instance = DataService()
    
    //"categories" is an array of type Category
    //It is private so that no one can access or modify the info from another class, VC, etc
